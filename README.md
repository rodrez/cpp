# Airgead Bank Investment App

AirGead Bank Investment app is a simple command line interface program used to calculate interest. 

## Summary

The app purpose is to help the user have a visual representation of how the interest works throughout the years. The user would enter the **Initial Investment Amount**, the **Monthly Deposit**, **Annual Interest** and the **Numbers of Years.** Once the program is provided with that information, it will display to the screen a report with detailed information about about the balance and interest without additional monthly deposits, and another with the same information plus additional monthly deposits. 

## What did you do particularly well?

I was very fond of how I was able to link multiple files appropriately while following best practices. On top of that being able to ask the user for additional input and adding validation was something I feel I did pretty well.

## Challenges

At first, one of the biggest challenges was wrapping my head around the idea of header files. Since I am new to C++, headers files is something that I found a little bit complicated. However, after doing some simple practice programs, watching The Cherno videos an Stack Overflow examples. I was able to grasp the basic concept behind the header files.

## Transferable Skills

For the most part, the majority of skills learned in this project and course work overall can be transferred to different programming areas. I believe having a strong foundation specially in programming can be helpful towards learning and applying that knowledge in different task/projects.

## Maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In order to make this program maintainable, the code have been split into multiple files reducing the clutter. Since it is very important for any piece of code to be readable not only by the creator but other programmers, the code has been properly commented and follow the best practices.
